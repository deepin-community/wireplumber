wireplumber (0.5.1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  WirePlumber 0.5 was released with a new configuration system.
  The new system is based on JSON instead of Lua which makes WirePlumber >= 0.5
  incompatible with Lua conf files written for WirePlumber 0.4.
  .
  If only the default configuration (e.g the configuration shipped with the
  Debian package) is used, then there is nothing to do.
  .
  If you use custom configuration files, you will have to manually update them
  by following the migration guide. No automatic migration of old configuration
  files is performed.
  .
  This guide is available at (after having installed "wireplumber-doc"):
    /usr/share/doc/wireplumber/html/daemon/configuration/migration.html
  or

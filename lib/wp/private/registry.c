/*
 * WpRegistry:
 *
 * The registry keeps track of registered objects on the wireplumber core.
 * There are 3 kinds of registered objects:
 *
 * 1) PipeWire global objects, which live in another process.
 *
 *    These objects are represented by a WpGlobal with the
 *    WP_GLOBAL_FLAG_APPEARS_ON_REGISTRY flag set. They appear when
 *    the registry_global() event is fired and are removed by
 *    registry_global_remove(). These objects do not have an associated
 *    WpProxy, unless there is at least one WpObjectManager that is interested
 *    in them. In this case, a WpProxy is constructed and it is owned by the
 *    WpGlobal until the global is removed by the registry_global_remove() event.
 *
 * 2) PipeWire global objects, which were constructed by this process, either
 *    by calling into a remove factory (see wp_node_new_from_factory()) or
 *    by exporting a local object (WpImplSession etc...).
 *
 *    These objects are also represented by a WpGlobal, which may however be
 *    constructed before they appear on the registry. The associated WpProxy
 *    calls into wp_registry_prepare_new_global() at the time it receives
 *    the 'bound' event and creates a global that has the
 *    WP_GLOBAL_FLAG_OWNED_BY_PROXY flag enabled. As the flag name suggests,
 *    these globals are "owned" by the WpProxy and the WpGlobal has no ref
 *    on the WpProxy itself. This allows destroying the proxy in client code
 *    by dropping its last reference.
 *
 *    Normally, these global objects also appear on the pipewire registry. When
 *    this happens, the WP_GLOBAL_FLAG_APPEARS_ON_REGISTRY flag is also added
 *    and that keeps an additional reference on the global (both flags must
 *    be dropped before the WpGlobal is destroyed).
 *
 *    In some cases, such an object might appear first on the registry and
 *    then receive the 'bound' event. In order to handle this situation, globals
 *    are not advertised immediately when they appear on the registry, but
 *    they are added on a tmp_globals list instead, which is emptied on the
 *    next core sync. In all cases, the proxy 'bound' and the registry 'global'
 *    events will be fired in the same sync cycle, so we can catch a late
 *    'bound' event and still associate the proxy with the WpGlobal before
 *    object managers are notified about the existence of this global.
 *
 * 3) WirePlumber global objects (WpModule, WpPlugin, WpSiFactory).
 *
 *    These are local objects that have nothing to do with PipeWire. They do not
 *    have a global id and they are also not subclasses of WpProxy. The registry
 *    always owns a reference on them, so that they are kept alive for as long
 *    as the WpCore is alive.
